# CS231N-assignment
My solution of cs231n-assignment

### assignment 2

In the first part, we implement a **fully connected network** by modular methods. Firstly, we implement the **affine forward** and **backward**, **ReLU forward** and **backward**. And then, we implement a simple **two-layer network**. Using the Solver class, we train our model. We also implement **muti-layer networks**. At last, we implement the **RMSProp** and **Adam** arithmetic.
